                    <h3>When the River rose in Delhi</h3>
                    <p>
                       Life came to a halt in several parts of Delhi as the Yamuna river, which was flowing at an all-time high, inundated many areas of the city. Alisha Dutta and Nikhil M. Babu report on how encroachments as well as official ‘developmental’ works continue to take place along the river despite warnings from the National Green Tribunal

                       The Yamuna in Delhi swelled to 207.55 metres on Wednesday, breaching its all-time record of 207.49 metres set in 1978, government agencies said on Wednesday. According to the Central Water Commission's (CWC) flood-monitoring portal, the water level at the Old Railway Bridge crossed the 207-metre mark at 4 am, the first time since 2013, and rose to 207.55 metres by 1 pm.

                       Section 144 CrPC prevents unlawful assembly of four or more persons and public movement in groups

                       It shot up from 203.14 metres at 11 am on Sunday to 205.4 at 5 pm on Monday, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 metres 18 hours earlier than expected.

                        Due to the rise of water level of Yamuna to 206.4 meters now, the working of old Yamuna bridge (Old Loha Pul) is being suspended from 2215 hrs today.

                        The water level of the Yamuna river in Delhi has once again risen above the danger level due to localised showers and rain in the upper catchment areas. The river has been fluctuating around the danger level for several days but has not reached the unprecedented level it reached in July. Officials have warned flood-affected people not to return to their homes and have set up relief camps for over 15,000 displaced individuals. The government is maintaining vigilance and has created sandbag embankments to prevent future floods. A survey is also being conducted to identify those eligible for compensation.                    </p>
